A Javascript Box2d Pony 

Box2d Is a 2d Physics Engine created by Erin Catto - https://box2d.org/author/ecatto/
There are various wrapper languages that have been made for his original work, I chose to use the JavaScript version

Currently it just has the pony, eventually the goal is a cute diorama scene where you can jiggle things. It's fun to play with.
